# WithTheDarkness

### About the project 
This is a survival horror game with first-person perspective, featuring 3D graphics and incorporating elements of both survival and roguelike genres.

In the game, players must navigate through stages, each uniquely arranged in every session. The paths are composed of predefined locations, though these may vary, and items such as bullets and oil, as well as adversaries, appear randomly.

The primary objective is to confront enemies and ensure survival. Players must continually explore the locations, searching for oil to illuminate their surroundings; failure to do so results in death. The game introduces an element of uncertainty through the random distribution of locations, adding to the challenge. Notably, visibility is severely limited, making it impossible to see beyond one's immediate surroundings, creating an atmosphere of suspense and requiring players to exercise caution as they progress.


The game is still under development. 
  
A few words about Unity. This engine was chosen because of its simplicity, a lot of indie, mobile and other games are made on this engine. The engine is great for small and inexpensive games, does not contain unnecessary elements, and the c# language is incredibly convenient.

#### The <ins>[unit tests](https://github.com/BlutBad1/WithTheDarkness/tree/main/Assets/Tests)</ins> are in the <ins>[Assets -> Tests](https://github.com/BlutBad1/WithTheDarkness/tree/main/Assets/Tests)</ins> folder.
#### Unity has its own multithreading system and it has its own special features
#### I made several pdf files about multithreading in Unity. (Ukrainian language)

### I recommend reading them in this order:
