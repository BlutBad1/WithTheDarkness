Unity game is currently under development. 

The game is a first-person horror game with roguelike elements.

The meaning of the game is the passage of stages, which are located differently in each session.


Each game session has a different path consisting of pre-made locations. Also, these locations may not appear at all. In addition to this, objects (at the moment these are bullets and oil) and opponents also randomly appear.


At the moment the following things have been implemented:
- Character movement
- Interface
- Dealing damage
- Modeling, sound, animations, etc. revolver
- Hitting enemies
- Opponents pathfinding
- Move between locations
- Random sequence of locations (zones)
- Picking of some items
- Random item spawn
- Footstep sound with different sound on different surfaces
- Lamp and its gameplay element
- Many other things...


A few words about Unit. This engine was chosen because of its simplicity, a lot of indie, mobile and other games are made on this engine. The engine is great for small and inexpensive games, does not contain unnecessary elements, and the c# language is incredibly convenient.
