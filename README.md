### About the project 
  This is a 3D first-person horror game with survival and roguelike elements. 
  The point of the game is to pass stages, which are arranged differently in each session.
Each game session has its own path, consisting of pre-created locations. Alternatively, these locations may not appear at all. In addition, items 
(currently bullets and oil) and opponents appear at random.

  The game is still under development.

A few words about Unit. This engine was chosen because of its simplicity, a lot of indie, mobile and other games are made on this engine. The engine is great for small and inexpensive games, does not contain unnecessary elements, and the c# language is incredibly convenient.
