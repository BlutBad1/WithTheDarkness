### About the project 
  This is a 3D first-person horror game with survival and roguelike elements. 
  The point of the game is to pass stages, which are arranged differently in each session.
Each game session has its own path, consisting of pre-created locations. Alternatively, these locations may not appear at all. In addition, items 
(currently bullets and oil) and opponents appear at random.

You have to fight the enemies and try to survive, and to do this you have to constantly move around the locations in search of oil for the light or you will die. And this is prevented by the above-mentioned random locational distribution. The main trick besides the random path is light and dark. You literally can't see further than your nose in the game, so you don't know what will be waiting for you ahead. So be wary.

  The game is still under development. 
  
  A few words about Unit. This engine was chosen because of its simplicity, a lot of indie, mobile and other games are made on this engine. The engine is great for small and inexpensive games, does not contain unnecessary elements, and the c# language is incredibly convenient.

## Lab№3 (Multithreading)
#### The <ins>[unit tests](https://github.com/BlutBad1/WithTheDarkness/tree/main/Assets/Tests)</ins> are in the <ins>[Assets -> Tests](https://github.com/BlutBad1/WithTheDarkness/tree/main/Assets/Tests)</ins> folder.
#### Unity has its own multithreading system and it has its own special features
#### I made several pdf files about multithreading in Unity. (Ukrainian language)

### I recommend reading them in this order:
